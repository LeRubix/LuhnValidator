# Luhn Validator

## Overview
The Luhn Validator is a simple application that uses Luhn's algorithm to validate bank card numbers. This program is primarily designed for educational purposes, providing users with a straightforward way to understand how Luhn's algorithm works.

## Features
- Validates bank card numbers using Luhn's algorithm.
- Displays a popup dialog with the validation result.
- Includes an informative popup that explains how Luhn's algorithm functions.

## Usage
To use the Luhn Validator, you can either run the executable file or use the python source code from the repo.

### Running the Executable
1. Download the `Luhn Validator.zip` executable file from the [releases page](https://github.com/LeRubix/LuhnValidator/releases/latest).
2. Run the executable to launch the application.
3. Enter a card number and click "Validate" to check its validity.

### Running the Python Source Code
1. Ensure you have Python 3.x installed on your machine.
2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install PyQt6
   ```
3. Download the source code file `luhnvalidator.py`.
4. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python luhnvalidator.py
   ```

## How It Works
Luhn's algorithm is a simple checksum formula used to validate a variety of identification numbers, such as credit card numbers. For more information, you can refer to the [Wikipedia page on Luhn's algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luhn_algorithm).
